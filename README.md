# AED Final Project - Vaccine Distribution System

Vaccine Distribution System<br />
Our project is about Vaccine Distribution System. The working of our project is as follows:<br />

These events are not dependent on each other – <br />

Initially, the local Health Department Admin adds the population of a created state.<br />
The manufacturer manufactures a particular drug.<br />
The CDC(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) officer places an order for a drug to the manufacturer.<br />
Providers (hospital provider/remote clinic provider) place an order for a drug that they need.<br />

The events mentioned below happen in sequence – <br />

First, the manufacturer ships the drug ordered by the CDC to a distributor.<br />
The distributor then stores this drug in a warehouse.<br />
If the remote clinic provider has placed a request for a particular drug, this order first needs to be approved by the hospital provider. Then it follows the same sequence as below.<br />
The local Health Department admin approves the order placed by the providers.<br />
This order then needs to be approved by the CDC officer.<br />
Once the order is approved by the CDC officer, the distributor is permitted to ship the same to the providers.<br />
The providers add the received drugs to their inventory.<br />
The providers can then administer this drug to the patients.
